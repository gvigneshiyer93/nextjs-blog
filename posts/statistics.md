** Exploration of Body Measurement database** 

August 31, 2019

The aim of the study is to study the body measurements database, tidy the data, take a variable and examine the summary statistics and perform different empirical and visual tests for checking the normality of the variable for males and females seperately. After analysing different variables, I chose to concentrate on Chest Diameter (che.di) because the spread was different males and females. I have used Shapiro-Wilk’s test and Jarque-Bera’s test for testing normality empirically and Density plot, Q-Q plot and histogram overlapped with the normal curve for visually testing the normality. You can refer to the detailed report below!

**Global CO2 emmisions**

October 22, 2019

- This investigation seeks to explore if there was any difference in the CO2 emission between two decades viz. 1994-2003 and 2004-2013
- We combined the CO2 emissions of years from 1994 to 2003 and 2004 to 2013 and performed paired t-test to find out if there was a significant difference in pollution over the two decades.
